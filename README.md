# Data Visualization Project

## Data

The data I propose to visualize for my project is from the [Kaggle:PM2.5 Global Air Pollution 2010-2017 (Mean Annual Exposure for 240 Countries)](https://www.kaggle.com/kweinmeister/pm25-global-air-pollution-20102017) via  [Gist: PM2.5 Global Air Pollution Dataset (From 2010-2017)](https://gist.github.com/rioto9858/169d0de7a0e01e996ece1be53b1b79b9)

## Prototypes

Iâ€™ve created a proof of concept visualization of this data. It's a ... and it shows ...

(please put a screenshot of one or more visualizations of this dataset you already made, for previous assignments)

## Questions & Tasks

The following tasks and questions will drive the visualization and interaction decisions for this project:

 * Is the PM2.5 air pollution value reduced these years?
 * What is the distribution of the PM2.5 air pollution in the world? 
 * Does the PM2.5 distribution change from 2010 to 2017?
 * Which country has the most effective way to control the pollution?

## Sketches

(insert one or more hand-drawn sketches of interactive visualizations that you imagine)
(describe each sketch - how is the data visualized, what are the interactions, and how do these relate to the questions/tasks)

## Open Questions

* I am not sure how to get the geographic shapes to build up a map from this data.
* I am not sure whether I can implement a map only based on the country name without the latitude and longitude.
* I do not clearly know how to implement interaction elements on html.
